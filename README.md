# TNM_project
Code for the final project in the TNM course

List of problems:

1) SCR MO
    - test circuit, in particular together with experiment
    - fix synchronization problem of matlab instances
    
2) Experimental design
    A. Theory
        - DONE

    B. Practice
        - Test it.


    C. Design behavioral questionnaire with 3 questions: 
        - order questions appropriately
        - print 15x
    
3) Run the experiment
    A. Recruit participants
        - find incentives (money)
        - Tell people that cue-stimulus-prediction-probability changes over time (also tell boundaries)
    B. Run experiment

4) Analysis pipeline LUKAS
    i. HGF: basic analysis (posterior expectation)
        - think up pipeline for analysis 
            + which HGFs are fitted
            + which parameters are compared and HOW
            + understand theory behind RFX analysis and write down how we would apply it to our data, concretely (inputs)
        - SCR
            + postprocess data (filtering, synchronizing, etc.)
            + how to incorporate it
            + binarize SCR data and repeat HGF analysis
            + cross-modality correlation
    ii. HGF: fancy analysis (biased response model)
        - code up response model of variable bias
        - simulate some data and scrutinize it
        
5) Presentation
    - assign subtasks
    - think about marketing
    - wrap things up inside a coherent story
    - make nice plots
    
6) Report
    - find out when it's due
