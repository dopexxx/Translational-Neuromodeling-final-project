### This repository contains 
1. All the data that was acquired during the behavioral experiment.
2. All the code that was used to:
    1. Generate and conduct the behavioral experiment
    2. Analyse the acquired data
    3. Generate the Figures shown in the presentation and/or the report
3. The documentation of the project in forms of:
    1. The presentation given in class
    2. The written report
    3. Figures presented in either of the presentation or the report


In order to orient yourself, please note that:

1.  /ops            contains all the code
2.  /data           contains the raw measurements as well as the post-hoc analysis files
3.  /report         contains the latex files to generate the report
4.  experiment.m    is the file that was executed to run the experiment
5.  metadata.mat    contains a structure specifying the experimental hyperparameter (stimuli presentation time etc.)
6.  run_analysis.m  can be executed in order to redo the analysis
